# logoff-script
**ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS**
This is a Python 3 script to sign off a user from windows after a certain amount of time. For example, if your child is spending too much time on their tablet or laptop, you can use this program. You can change the amount of time in the script after you clone/download this repo. If you're having trouble trying to make this program run when the user logs in, use the keyboard shortcut "windows + r" and type in "shell:startup". Then that will take you to a folder for the user you are currently logged in as, which will have all the files that you want to run when the user logs in to windows so you will put the vbscript file there then you will place the batchfile and the python file in C:/Users/<username>.
